        We are happy to announce that our first in-person location is slated to
        open in Summer 2024! Since 2018, we have been dedicated to helping
        create incredible brewing experiences around the world, but itâ€™s time to
        bring these experiences straight to you. We cannot wait for this new
        endeavour and we are looking forward to serving the Vancouver community.
        Keep an eye out on our socials in the coming weeks for an opening date.
